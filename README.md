BB10-Facebook-Connector
=======================

Hi guys! 
We have been working on [BB10 app of Liverpool Football Club](http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/28055657/?countrycode=GB) and found that there is no decent Facebook API library for BlackBerry 10 yet. 
So we had to create our own one and decided to share it with community so everybody can benefit. Please feel free to send pull request and generally feedback and suggest any imporvements.

Supported Facebook API functionality:
-

- Login/logout (authorization);
 
- Load user profile;

- FB places (loading places near defined coordinates, the places lists are stored on FB);

- Make Post on user wall

- Load the FB home page;

- Load user posts;

- Show user`s wall (feed)

- Friends list;

- Facebook note;

- User status message;

- Check-in (on the map)

- Load images;

- Load video;

- Like/dislike;

- Load comments to the post;

- Load list of users who liked the post;

- Write comment to a post;

- Get the link to your picture from user profile;

- Get the info if I already liked this post before of not


all the best!
